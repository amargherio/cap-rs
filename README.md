# CAP-rs
A Rust library for interacting with systems that implement the [Common Alerting Protocol](http://docs.oasis-open.org/emergency/cap/v1.2/CAP-v1.2-os.html).
This crate intends to implement version 1.2 of the protocol. Support for versions
lower than 1.2 will be determined and designed after the completion of the 1.2 effort.

# Usage
TBD

# Building and Testing
A local build from source can be completed by running `cargo build --release`.
The test suite can be run via the `cargo test` command. For additional support,
check the cargo documentation via `cargo help test`.
